           Once again a severe outbreak of storms tear up the south eastern part of the US resulting in over 70 injuries. 18 confirmed tornadoes occurred over the span of 3 days, the highest being an EF3 south of Houston. The tornado touched down in Brookside Village, and traveled 18 miles to Wooster. It reached peak winds of 140 mph and pea sized hail (0.25”). This storm was issued as a <em>Tornado Emergency.</em>
Luckily no injuries or deaths emerged from this tornado.

       <p>
           A Tornado Emergency is when a large tornado, typically EF-2+, has touched down in or near a large populated area, such as a city or suburb. The NWS (National Weather Service) will report these warnings over tv stations, radio, mobile devices, and tornado sirens. If a Tornado Emergency is issued in your area, it's important to take cover immediately.

        The outlook issued by the SPC on Friday had predictions of a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes, a 15% risk for winds, and a 5% risk for hail. They stated this storm as an Enhanced risk (3 out of 5).

           These early severe supercell clusters have been continuously slamming the US nonstop. This is because of the jet stream pattern. The jet stream has been constantly in the lower half of the United States, causing a warm inflow to reach the Gulf of Mexico. This combined with easterly winds and “Atmospheric Rivers” are prime setups for disaster. However, as we move towards February things are changing. Now the jet stream is on the move northward. That's going to let Canadian Polar Vortexes travel south into the US. These Polar Vortexes push out the warm inflow, creating a winter event. This is already in effect as we saw a rare snow tornado form in Wednesday's storm. These changes are going to bring cold temperatures eastward with a potential for below average temperatures and snowstorms become more likely.

           The best thing to do before and after a storm is to prepare. Grab all necessary equipment like portable heaters, non-perishable food, water, blankets, and have a sustainable shelter that can keep you warm. Have a battery powered radio and a portable charger for your mobile devices. Once the storm hits it’s best to stay put in your location until the NWS says it’s safe to travel to get relief.
